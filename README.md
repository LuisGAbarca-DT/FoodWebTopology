##Overview

Computes various structural and topological indices for a food web, Including
- Number of species by category (basal, intermediate, top)
- Connectivity and centrality values
- Trophic levels
- Modularity (using Leiden algorithm
- And other topological metrics

Generates random food webs through different null models and compares them to 
observed food web structure. All results are exported as comma-delimited files.


## Data Format Requirements

The adjacency matrix should be in CSV format with:
- **Columns** = predators
- **Rows** = prey  
- **Values**: 0 (no interaction) or 1 (predation)
- **Requirements**:
  - Square matrix (same species order in rows and columns)
  - At least one basal species (in-degree = 0)
  - At least one top species (out-degree = 0)
  - No isolated nodes or disconnected groups

## Quick Start


### 1. Setup
- Download all FWTopo files to a single folder
- Place your food web CSV file in the same folder
- Set R's working directory to this folder


### 2. Run Analysis

source("run_FWTopo.R")```
    
- This will install all dependencies and load the libraries

### 3. Follow Prompts

- Select the csv file with the food web data
- Choose the randomization model
- Enter the number of random food webs to be generated
- Enter the resolution for the Leiden Modularity algorithm (higher = more modules)
    

Considering the data file name, the resuts will be saved according with this
name as a prefix of the type of analysis presented. For example, if the file 
name of the data is your_we.csv then the program will genrate a directory with 
that name and inside it two more directories, one with the results for the 
original data and one more with the results for the randomized webs.Following 
is an example of the structure of the directories:

### Features
- Multiple Null Models: Cascade, Niche, Erdős–Rényi, and custom algorithms
- Comprehensive Metrics: 20+ structural and topological indices
- Modularity Analysis: Leiden algorithm with adjustable resolution
- Validation Checks: Automated data integrity verification
- Reproducible: Complete analysis logging and parameter tracking
